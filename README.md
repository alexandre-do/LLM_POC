## üìö Purpose

The goal of this repository is to explore and evaluate the potential of LLMs in addressing multi-modal and agentic approche. By testing various models and techniques, this project aims to provide insights into the following:

- Application of LLMs for text-to-sql, text-to-image, chat conversation ...
- Comparative performance of different LLM architectures and configurations.
- Experimentation with fine-tuning and model integration for solving domain-specific tasks.
